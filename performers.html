#DoingGoodisContagious, and that is what The Jubilee Project uses as the basis of their unique, groundbreaking model of raising money charity.  In aftermath of the Haiti earthquake in January 2010, The Jubilee Project decided to raise $100 for Haiti by in the subway station. While that raised $70, the online video they created about it ended raising over $700 for Haiti earthquake relief.  Encouraged by the results, Eric, Jason, and Eddie formed the Jubilee Project, whose mission is to make videos for a good cause. Their vision is to produce entertaining content that will empower, enable, and inspire others to do good as well.

Todd A. DeBonis is the author of the popular The Monkey King's Daughter series, which chronicles the adventures of Meilin Cheng, a 14-year old Asian-American high school girl who learns she is the daughter of the mythical Monkey King.  Before he was a writer, Mr. Debonis was the senior producer and director of Words that Cook! Parenting with children's books, a television series that won the International Reading Association's Broadcast Media Award for Television in 2005.  He was also the screenwriter for the animated film, White Fang, and the writer of the Bingo & Molly Show on the Learning Channel.  Mr. Debonis has also traveled extensively, loves aquaculture, and owns a small shrimp hatchery in Vietnam - but that's a story for another day...<br><br>
As author of The Monkey King's Daughter series, Mr. DeBonis is proud to lend the books to any fundraising effort, foundation or charity that offers children anywhere in the world a chance at a better life. China Care Foundation is chief among them. <br><br>
Though Mr. DeBonis will not be speaking at the event, he is willing to talk to any parents, children, or supporters interested in learning more about his books and work.  Autographed copies of his books are also available through our silent auction.
